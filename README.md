# Rider-Driver Batched Matching Simulation
Rider-Driver Batched Matching Simulation using Branch and Bound Algorithm.
> This program simulate Rider-Driver Batched Matching by generated randomly between 0 - 5 riders & drivers with random coordinate in each second of bacthing time.
> The first rider is simulated to be yourself (first requester) hence, coordinate can be inputted.

## Program Requirements
```markdown
JDK 17

```

## Get Started

```
> javac MainSimulation.java // compile
> java MainSimulation // run
// after that, insert first rider coordinate and batch time as instructed
